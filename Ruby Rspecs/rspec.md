Testing with Rspec

- Writing tests just like English Language 
- gem install rspec
- rspec --init

- describe()
    - set of related tasks
    - before and after method like setup and teardown
    - can pass in either :each or :all (infrequently used) to specify whether the block will run

- it()
    - takes an option string
    - Main Logic happens inside it
    
# for running rspec just type `rspec`
