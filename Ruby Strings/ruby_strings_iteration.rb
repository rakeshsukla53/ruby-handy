# now Strings class is no longer an Enumerable
'''
EACH_byte iterates sequentially through the individual bytes that comprise a string;
EACH_char iterates the characters and is more efficient than [] operator or character indexing;
EACH_codepoint iterates over the ordinal values of characters in the string;
EACH_line iterates the lines.
